          <li>
            <h3>THINKING</h3>
          </li>
          In particular the programme focused on problem solving, design thinking and computational thinking.
          <li>
            <h3>DISCERNING CODES</h3>
          </li>
          Analysing language, symbols, and texts in order to understand and make sense of the codes in which knowledge is expressed.
          <li>
            <h3>SELF-MANAGEMENT</h3>
          </li>
          Projects and challenges are designed to motivate students to explore and experiment with self-motivation.
          <li>
            <h3>RELATIONSHIPS WITH PEERS</h3>
          </li>
          The programme is designed with unplugged sessions where students interact in a range of different situations, including things like being able to listen well, recognise different points of view, and share ideas.
          <li>
            <h3>PARTICIPATION AND COLLABORATION</h3>
          </li>
          The programme encourages students to be involved in communities, such as family, whanau, school, and contribute and make connections with other people.
